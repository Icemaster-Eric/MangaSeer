# MangaSeer
Learn Japanese by reading manga! (Demo video coming soon)

## How it works
MangaSeer applies an overlay transparent to mouse and keyboard events to any selected region of your screen. It then uses an object detection model to locate both vertical and horizontal Japanese text, with or without furigana. By hovering over the Japanese text, it will display an unobtrusive popup next to the text with options such as text-to-speech, generating furigana, translation, and more.

## Why should I use MangaSeer?
MangaSeer aims to make raw manga a viable source for any Japanese learner. If you're ever unsure of the pronunciation, or the meaning of a word, you can immediately get the answer by hovering over the text. This makes it easy to immerse yourself in manga without having to look up meanings of words or pronunciations.

## Installation
There will be prepackaged executables for Windows. Cross-platform support may come in the future.

## Contributions
I usually procrastinate and never finish any of my projects. Once [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/) is over, any pull requests/issues will only be reviewed if I'm in an especially productive mood.

**Important**: At this point in time, please don't open any issues. The code is broken as hell.
